Ez2Cloud Software Documentation EZ2Cloud is a cloud-based software, developed by DevGo, to provide an inventory and classification solution to data on folders and files stored in an on-premise file server. Here you will find all Software documentation and detailed information on use and configuration required. The software main goal is to provide support tools to be used on File Servers data migration process. With all the features allowing organize, classify and labeling file serves network shares contents based on the metadata for files and folders this is the better option to move on-premise servers contents to a cloud service in fast, reliable, secure and with minimum workload effort. Overview We want to deliver support tools that allow a smooth transition between on-premises network file servers to cloud. The main issue with this transition on most companies is using the current available automation tools to copy data volumes still needs a lot of human and hands tasks. We aim to bring to the mininum as possible the needed task and let the automation tools works as smooth as possible. Most tools used for data copy must have the input in a specific format, but theirs is no means that allows one to create an underlined structured of the data from a company organization view, identify orphan data or set data ownership in an end-user friendly approach. Ez2Cloud was designed and implemented to address these issues. It is possible to export from Ez2Cloud a file formatted and ready to be used by an automation process with the minimum human intervention. Different from existing solutions on this, Ez2cloud will allow you to include metadata and so set a clear and concise view of structure, ownership and custom labels you want to apply to a shared network data on a file server. All the configurations tasks, settings definitions, customizations and requirements to complete before running E2Cloud on your company will be the content of the following sections.

We're glad to have you here. As a Ez2Cloud end-user you have access to all the features your subscription includes, except Ez2Cloud administrator features. Of course these features are restricted for a user as member of an admin account. For specific information on configuring Ez2Cloud see the Administrator documentation. Overview The functionalities and features you will find on these pages are related with the main goal of Ez2Cloud: provides a colaborative and distribuited platform that allows you define and apply all the elements required on a migration job from on server to another or from an on-premise server to a cloud service. To achieve this goal, Ez2Cloud relies in gathering data and produce information related with metada from files and folders located on a server network shared folder. Specifically the data that will be gatther from the users that actually works with the file servers contents in a distrubted and colaborative approach. The metadata gather from server will be mapped to entities representing files and folders on Ez2cloud, allowing each user to apply to files amd folders some labels. To sum up the platform will presents the users some file and let them assign labels, owners and with all the data gather and processed later on an authorized user can create and export a file with items that will be the source data for the migration. In order to provide insight in with the concepts needed to properly use Ez2 Cloud, read the following articles Entities and Concepts Details Also in our documetantion you can find out Use cases how you can use Ez2Cloud features to implement better solutions on migratation file servers contents.

So this will be the second approach where project it is the basic unit of work and users accessing projects on the end-user interface.
