Ez2Cloud support and documentation EZ2Cloud is a cloud-based software, developed by DevGo, to provide a solution to inventory and labeling folders and files stored on the company files server. Here you will find all Software documentation. Ez2Cloud it is a software which the main goal is provide support tools be used on File Servers data migration process. With all the features allowing organize, classify and labeling file serves network shares contents based on the metadata for files and folders this is the better option to move on-premise servers contents to a cloud service in fast, reliable, secure and with minimum workload effort. Overview We are seeking to deliver support tools that allow a smooth transition between on-premises network file servers to cloud. The main issue with this transition on most companies it is guarantee the use of automation tools to copy data volumes with less human intervention as possible. To do so, it is mandatory to maintain the data files but also all the metadata. Most tools used for data copy must have the input in a specific format, but theirs is no means that allows one to create an underlined structured of the data from a company organization view, identify orphan data or set data ownership in an end-user friendly approach. Ez2Cloud was designed and implemented to address these issues. It is possible to export from Ez2Cloud a file formatted and ready to be used by an automation process with the minimum human intervention. Different from existing solutions on this, Ez2cloud will allow you to include metadata and so set a clear and concise view of structure, ownership and custom labels you want to apply to a shared network data on a file server. All the configurations tasks, settings definitions, customizations and requirements to fulfil before use E2Cloud on your company will be the content of the following sections. Follow the links and you can access to specific concepts that one will need to get up and running with Ez2Cloud.

We're glad to have you here! As a Ez2Cloud user you have access to all the features your subscription includes, except Ez2Cloud administrator features, unless you have an admin account. For specific information on configuring Ez2Cloud see the Administrator documentation. Overview The main goal of Ez2Cloud it is provides functionalities and features that allows you define and apply all the data required to be used on a migration job from on server to another, including moving data from an on-premise server to a cloud service. To achieve this goal Ez2Cloud relies in processs to gather, process and produce information related with a network shared folder. Specifically the data that will be gatther from the users that actually works with the file servers contents on a company in a distrubted and colaborative approach. These data will be mapped to files matada, allowing each user to apply to files amd folders labels. To sum up the platform will presents the users some file and let them assign labels, owners and with all the data gather and processed later on an authorized user can create and export a file with items that will be the source data for the migration. To get familiar with the concepts needed to properly use Sharelabel, read the following articles Entities and Concepts Details Also in our documetantion you can find out Use cases how you can use Ez2Cloud features to implement better solutions on migratation file servers contents.

Project it is the unit of data that users will work in a distrubted and colaborative approach and it encapsulate a network shared folder metada providing all the users with access to that network shared folder a structured and user-friendly view on it from the Ez2Cloud interface. Before any activity the Ez2cloud admin user from your company must create a project that will be the starting point where users can view and label the files and folders. The concept it is realized with two differents approaches: First the project must be defined and set. This is done on the backend only by a user with Administratr role. After the configuration and setting for a project it is done it will be available to colaborative works. So this will be the second approach where project it is the basic unit of work and users accessing projects on the end-user interface. Only a user with Administrator or Project Administrator role can add a new project. When doing so, it is mandatory to provide a name, description, an end date. Also the project as it the view from Ez2Cloud to a shared network folder on create the project it is mandatory to define local network path. This is the absolute path to a folder on the company File Server. If need the project must also get user name and password to authencate the access. As represented on Ez2Cloud, a project gets files and folders metada from a company file server. This process is performed by a component of Ez2Cloud that will be run on on-premise server named Ez2Cloud sattelite service. For more information, please see Ez2Cloud sattelite service When creating a project it is defined which users and labels will be available. Also there are settings like date that the projected will be archived and notification that will be fired when the project is about to be archived. The project as a base unit of work will be available and, in the context of the implemented proces,s the application front end delivers features and functionalities to end users. So all users assigned to a project after logged in can view it and completed task based on data the project have.
