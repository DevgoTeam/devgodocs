## Tenant

Tenant is a term used for an Organization hosted on the Devgo platform.
The Tenant is the container for items of your Organization such as products, domains, subscriptions etcâ€¦
When you create a tenant for your organization, we will then register a DNS entry by default.  
Imagine the tenant name we are picking is "yourexample". The following DNS entry will be created :

- yourorganization.devgo.org

It is mandatory that you create a Tenant, or in other words register your organization into our platform in order to start using Sharelabel product.
