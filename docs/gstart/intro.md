## Getting start

To start using Sharelabel first you need to configure a sharelabel context for your company or 	this must be done by your IT Administrator team. 
	
The Sharelabel context of your company includes some configuration data that it is required to 	access and prepares the use of the product on a specific company.  in most cases it starts with 	the creation of a Tenant if you are someone who is establishing a company context.
