## Label

Labels are the way you will categorize the files and folders within your projects.
The administrator can create as many as needed, by giving them a name, a description and personalize them with colors.

The labels are only available for a project if the administrator assigned them, otherwise they just don't appear for the users.

At the end you will figure out that adding labels to files and folders will be your main job.

Here you see examples of labels assigned to a projects:
